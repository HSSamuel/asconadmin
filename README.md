## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

---

## 🌍 Deployment (Netlify)

This project is pre-configured for deployment on **Netlify**.

### The `_redirects` File

Because this is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using client-side routing, a `_redirects` file is included in the `public` folder:

```plaintext
/* /index.html  200
```

This ensures that refreshing routes (e.g., `/users`) does not result in a 404 error on the live site.

---

### Deployment Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repository to **Netlify**
2. Set the **Build Command** to:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Set the **Publish Directory** to:

   ```plaintext
   build
   ```
4. Add `REACT_APP_API_URL` under **Netlify → Environment Variables**
